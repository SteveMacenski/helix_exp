#Helix Experiment with ABB IRB120 and Intel Realsense R200

## Collection Pipeline:

> roslaunch helix_exp helix_calib.launch


This will run calibration with tag on robot EE. Input joint angles when asked and it will generate calibration file in current directory. Place into the experimental_data_and_errors directory

> roslaunch helix_exp helix_exp.launch


Will run the paths in the "robot_paths.txt" file in experimental_data_and_errors. 

After, take the result_images, errors.txt, robot_paths.txt, and calibration file and zip them onto the external drive. in errors 3=good



## Pose Process Pipeline:

copy the result_images folder to home directory
place Makefile, im_seg.cpp, and post_process.sh in folder

> make 


Make the im_seg file to 'segm'

> ./post_process.sh


runs the post_process for all .bmp files in directory, stores the ROIandPnts images for troubleshooting, then rodPoints.txt file for the points. 

Zip folder and place this and the raw data into a descriptive folder name on the external drive



# Andy's work

He'll read in the points after a quick quality control check in matlab and run scripts.


TODO collection
        - get home pose angles 
        
TODO analysis
        - Clustering
        - 1'' from end of second side
        - adjust ROI to find rod on camera placement better (bttom)
        
        
DONE
        - speed control not 10 seconds
        

In experimental_data_and_errors directory:
        - errors.txt
        - result_images from collection
        - robot_paths.txt
        - SHOULD have calibration file, cd before running
